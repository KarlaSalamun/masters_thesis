The method of assigning jobs to resources with respect to job properties and system constraints is called a meta-algorithm.
A meta-algorithm uses priority functions to perform scheduling by assigning priority values to jobs and it corresponds to an arbitary scheduling environment. 
In this work, the considered environment is a single-machine environment where $n$ periodic tasks are processed on a single resource. 
A priority function used for generating schedules of all possible problem instances can be generated by genetic programming.
